# MarkovStringRandomizationSourceExtensions.GenerateRandomMarkov method (1 of 2)

Generates a String, derived from the patterns in *sources*, which is no longer than *maxLength*.

```csharp
public static string GenerateRandomMarkov(this IRandomizationSource randomizationSource, 
    IEnumerable<string> sources, int? maxLength = null, int chainLength = 1)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| randomizationSource | A [`IRandomizationSource`](../IRandomizationSource.md) providing values. |
| sources | Example strings. |
| maxLength | A desired maximum length. Defaults to the longest sequence in !:sources. |
| chainLength | Count of Char items which are used to select the next Char in the String. |

## Return Value

A String, derived from the patterns in *sources*, which is no longer than *maxLength*.

## Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentOutOfRangeException | Thrown when *chainLength* is less than 1. |
| ArgumentException | Thrown when *sources* is empty, if any items in *sources* are empty, or if *chainLength* exceeds the longest sequence in *sources*. |

# MarkovStringRandomizationSourceExtensions.GenerateRandomMarkov&lt;T&gt; method (2 of 2)

Generates a sequence of *T*, derived from the patterns in *sources*, which is no longer than *maxLength*.

```csharp
public static IReadOnlyList<T> GenerateRandomMarkov<T>(
    this IRandomizationSource randomizationSource, IReadOnlyCollection<IReadOnlyList<T>> sources, 
    int? maxLength = null, int chainLength = 1)
    where T : IEquatable<T>
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| T | An item. |
| randomizationSource | A [`IRandomizationSource`](../IRandomizationSource.md) providing values. |
| sources | Example sequences of *T*. |
| maxLength | A desired maximum length. Defaults to the longest sequence in !:sources. |
| chainLength | Count of sequential *T* items which are used to select the next item. |

## Return Value

A sequence of *T*, derived from the patterns in *sources*, which is no longer than *maxLength*.

## Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentOutOfRangeException | Thrown when *chainLength* is less than 1. |
| ArgumentException | Thrown when *sources* is empty, if any items in *sources* are empty, or if *chainLength* exceeds the longest sequence in *sources*. |
