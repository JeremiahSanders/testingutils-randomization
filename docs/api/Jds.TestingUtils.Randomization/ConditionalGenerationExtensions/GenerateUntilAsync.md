# ConditionalGenerationExtensions.GenerateUntilAsync&lt;TResult&gt; method (1 of 2)

Continuously generates values using the provided generator function until a value satisfies the given condition.

```csharp
public static Task<TResult> GenerateUntilAsync<TResult>(
    this IRandomizationSource randomizationSource, 
    Func<IRandomizationSource, Task<TResult>> generator, Func<TResult, bool> condition, 
    CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| TResult | The type of the values being generated. |
| randomizationSource | The source of randomization. |
| generator | A function that generates values of type *TResult*. This function receives this [`IRandomizationSource`](../IRandomizationSource.md) as a parameter. |
| condition | A predicate function that determines whether the generated value satisfies a condition. The first value which satisfies the condition is returned. |
| cancellationToken | An asynchronous cancellation token that can be used to cancel the operation. This token is verified before each iteration to allow for cancellation of the operation. |

## Return Value

A value of type *TResult* that satisfies the given condition.

## Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| OperationCanceledException | Thrown when *cancellationToken* is cancelled. |
| ObjectDisposedException | Thrown when the source associated with *cancellationToken* is disposed. |

## Remarks

This method is useful for generating values that meet specific criteria in situations where it is more efficient to simply retry value generation than to create a custom generation function.
